<h1>Come and Eat!</h1>
<hr>
Come and Eat! is a website created to facilitate community cooking sessions on a weekly basis. It offers an opportunity to learn how to cook while making personal connections with local community members based in London. 

I used the five planes of UX to plan this project.

<h2>Strategy</h2>
The purpose of the website is to give the users the ability to sign up for the sessions and any important information about upcoming events, which would be the venue location, pricing, dates and food menu. 

My goal was to create an easily understandable layout that would allow anyone to use the site successfully, since the sessions are open to anyone and everyone from the community.
