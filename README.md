<h1>Come and Eat!</h1>
<hr>
Come and Eat! is a website created to facilitate community cooking sessions on a weekly basis. It offers an opportunity to learn how to cook while making personal connections with local community members based in London. 

The purpose of the website is to give the users the ability to sign up for the sessions and access any important information about upcoming events, which would be the venue location, pricing, dates and food menu. 

My goal was to create an easily understandable layout that would allow anyone to use the site successfully, since the sessions are open to anyone and everyone from the community.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Navigation</li>
    The vavigation is at the top of each page. The logo, which has been created with the use of Google Fonts, is located at the top left and redirects the user to the Home page if clicked. On the top right, the menu items are listed: Home, About Us, Join Us and Contact Us.
    These navigation links are set in a dark colour on a light background, with text shadowing to add extra contrast for better accessibiity.
    These navigation links provide a clea directory for the user to understand how to interact with the site in order to achieve their desired result. 
    <li>Hero Image</li>
    The hero image is a colourful array of dishes on a long table, with people coming around from all sides to eat together. This image encompases what 'Come and Eat!' aims to achieve with the website, which is for people to interact with eachother through the shared experience of food. The text on top of the hero image acts as an invitation to  the user and acts as a short summary of what the website wants to offer within the first glance at the page.
    <li>Reasons to Join</li>
    Reasons to join are topped with icons sourced from FontAwesome and set against a dark background to show the user that this is a new section of the page. The aim is to give the user a reason to stay on the website, as well as to consider signing up to the sessions. This section is brought to a conclusion with the listing of the price and a call to action in the form of a "button" that redirects the user to the 'Join Us' page.  
    <li>Footer</li>
    The footer, like the header, has a light background colour to make it obvious that the user has reached the end of the page. It is has a simplistic design, only displaying large icons, sourced from FontAwesome, to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok with text to signify that these are social links. When clicked, the icons will take the user to a new tab for the respective social media site. 
    <li>About Us</li>
    The About As page follows the same colour blocking as the Home page to allow for a feeling of consistency all along the website. This section offers more in-depth reasoning as to why the user should sign up to the sessions. 
    This page also carries the same "button" as the Home page to encourage the user to visit the Join Us page.
    <li>Join Us</li>
    The Join Us page has been split into 2 columns.
    The first colum holds a table with the next month's events. In the table the user will be able to see all of the most useful information points, such as the venue location, food items and date. The table has a semi-transparent background to allow it to stand out against the page, but not affect the text visibility.
    The second column holds the form that users can sign up to the session with. This form has a simple layout, so as not to deter less technologically advanced users, and has field validation in the form of required fields. 
    <li>Contact US</li>
    The Contact Us page has the same 2-column layout at the Join Us page, but on the left-hand side the user can find vital contact information points. On the right, there is another form, this time for genreal enquiries, but it keeps the same field validation rules and collects the name, phone number and email information of the users as a means to get back in touch. All of these points on the page are accompanied by matching icons, to make the page's contents easy to understand from even a glance.
