                A group of locals started 'Come and Eat!' when the struggle to find motivation & inspiration to cook food after a long day of hard work became too much.
            </p>

            <p class="about">We get it- finding time to feed yourself a warm homemade meal can be hard sometimes. That's why we've created 'Come and Eat!', a community cooking events group, to take the pain of choosing your meals and sourcing the ingredients (while giving you a chance to make some great personal connections) for just Â£5 a session!                
            </p>

            <p class="about">
                Everyone is welcome! From all ages, backgrounds and dietary requirements.

Community is what makes us great, so just pop your suggestions in the message box while you sign up for a session and we'll come back to you within 48 hours. 
            </p>

            <p class="about">
